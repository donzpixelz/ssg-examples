## What this site is

A small, clean Eleventy setup you can grow at your own pace. Pages are plain Markdown, one base layout does the framing, and all styles live in `css/main.css`.

## How itâ€™s built

- **SSG:** Eleventy (11ty)
- **Templates:** Nunjucks layout (`_includes/base.njk`)
- **Content:** Markdown files in `app/eleventy_src/`
- **Assets:** Copied to `/eleventy/` on deploy (`css/`, `js/`)

## Why it exists

- Keep things **simple** so editing content never feels scary.
- Make design tweaks **incremental**â€”change one style at a time.
- Stay **portable**: no heavy frameworks or lock-in.

## Roadmap (short & sweet)

- Add a notes/blog section
- Improve typography scale in `main.css`
- Optional form handling for contact
- Light/Dark theme toggle (maybe!)
