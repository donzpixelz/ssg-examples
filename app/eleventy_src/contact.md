## Say hello

The simplest ways to reach me:

- Email: [you@example.com](mailto:you@example.com)
- GitHub: [github.com/your-handle](https://github.com/your-handle)
- X / Twitter: [@yourhandle](https://twitter.com/yourhandle)

### A quick note about forms

This site is static (on purpose). If you want a contact form later, you can:

- Use a forms service (Formspree, Basin, etc.) and point a simple `<form>` to it
- Or keep it old-school with a `mailto:` link (works everywhere, no backend)

For now, the links above are the fastest way to get a message to me.
