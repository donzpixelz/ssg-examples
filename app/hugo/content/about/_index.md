This site is a straightforward **Hugo example**: Markdown content under `content/`, templates in `layouts/`, and assets in `static/`. It’s deployed as static files to Nginx on an EC2 instance. The styles use a tiny custom theme with your blue **#3466cb**.

**What’s here**
- Minimal base template and split partials (`head`, `header`, `footer`)
- Clean list and single post layouts
- A starter stylesheet at `static/css/main.css`

**How to edit**
- Text → edit the Markdown files in `content/`
- Layouts → tweak files in `layouts/`
- Styles → adjust `static/css/main.css`

Need a fuller example later (taxonomies, shortcodes, etc.)? Easy to add.
